ABOUT DATASET
This is a Kaggle-sourced historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, which includes all games from Athens 1896 through Rio 2016.
Up to 1992, the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year. After that, they staggered them such that the Winter Games begin in 1994, then the Summer Games in 1996, the Winter Games in 1998, and so on. When evaluating this data, many individuals make the error of assuming that the Summer and Winter Games have always been staggered.
